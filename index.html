  <p>
   Hitterz Volleyball is a vibrant, multicultural club based in Auckland, welcoming players of all levels and backgrounds. The club originally began with a group of Filipino friends who met through social activities, like playing cards and spades, and quickly grew into a wider community of volleyball enthusiasts from various ethnicities.

Our mission is to develop volleyball at every level, starting with youth engagement through regional training sessions, small competitions, and social events. Hitterz provides opportunities for players to progress from beginner and social formats to competitive play. Many of our members begin by joining Regional competitions like The Great NZ volleyball tournamnet in Christchurch, which fosters competetive participation between filipinos and other ethnicities, before moving into other competitive leagues such as the Northern Club League, which is New Zealand's National Volleyball league.

Throughout the year, Hitterz runs social volleyball events for indoor, outdoor, grass, and beach formats, giving players of all ages a chance to enjoy the sport. Competitive teams participate in Northern Club League competitions from July to September, while summer beach volleyball focuses on friendly matches and social play at Auckland’s North Shore beaches.

At Hitterz Volleyball, we focus not only on building skills and competitiveness but also on fostering a strong sense of community and friendship across Auckland’s diverse population.
